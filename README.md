# GOG Extract, except its rewritten in bash
*yeah... thats about it*

## Usage:
`gogext.sh <game-installer-you-want-to-unpack.sh> <output-directory> (optionally)`

## Limitations:
- Speed of extraction process is far from being fast - blame dd's defaults. If you have any ideas regarding how to improve that - please let me know via issues

## License:
[WTFPL](LICENSE)

## Before you go:
Huge thanks to Yepoleb for his awesome [gogextract.py](https://github.com/Yepoleb/gogextract)! My abomination is just mere attempt to recreate his work in bash, so dont forget to check the original one
