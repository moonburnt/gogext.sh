# GOG Extract, except its rewritten in bash
*yeah... thats about it*

## Usage:
`gogext.sh <game-file-you-want-to-unpack.sh>`

## Limitations:

- Currently there is no support for custom output directory. Maybe will add that later
- Speed of extraction process is far from being fast - blame dd's defaults. If you have any ideas regarding how to improve that - please let me know via issues
